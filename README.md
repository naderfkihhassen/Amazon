# Amazon Clone Project

Live Demo: [Amazon Clone](https://naderfkihhassen.github.io/Amazon/amazon.html)

---

## Overview

This is a frontend-only amazon-style clone built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, using a static JSON file (`products.json`) as a mock backend. It was developed by following a YouTube tutorial and tailored to showcase product browsing, cart functionality, orders, and responsive design.

## Features

- Display of product items with images, name, price, and rating  
- Static “backend” via `products.json` to hold product data  
- Multiple pages: shop (`amazon.html`), checkout, orders, and tracking  
- Responsive layout that adapts to desktop and mobile  
- Visual design inspired by Amazon UI
